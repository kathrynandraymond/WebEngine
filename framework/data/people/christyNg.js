		"My little sister Christy is a big ball of energy, very friendly, and always willing to help a friend or family. This is probably why she works at Sales Coordinator at Silver Cloud. I love her even though we don't always share the same interest but it helps she eats the chicken feet while I help eat the leg and thigh. =) She is my friend, who I can call to complain or celebrate about anything and count on her support, strength and laughter.
