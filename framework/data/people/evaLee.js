		"Eva and I met at a friend's home as we tried to make egg tarts (dan tat). This was the first indication that Eva was a true foodie - searching for the best places to eat and try making the food as well. Eva worked at the same company as me so she understood my up and down work experiences. We've travelled to many places - Oregon lakes, Santa Barbara beaches, rocking climbing up, shopping & eating in NYC. Eva is a great friend, listener, seeker of yummy food, travel buddy and planner of many road trips and gatherings. "
